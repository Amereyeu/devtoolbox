## Features
If you're tired of endlessly looking online for the right tool, or to find again that website of which you don't recall the name to do a quick convertion, this is the right app for you.
This is a collection of powerful yet simple to use tools and utilities to solve the most common daily development problems:
 - JSON to YAML converter and vice-versa
 - Cron expressions parser
 - Base64 encoder and decoder
 - Formatters for common languages (more coming soon)
 - Hash generators
 - Regex checkers
 - Image converters and compressors
 - And much more
